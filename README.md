# Log in to Epic
The bot needs your credentials to login and get you the games. In `Manual.py` or `Auto.py`, wherever it says PUT EMAIL HERE or PUT PASSWORD HERE put in your email and password. Don't forget to put these inside the quotation marks. Don't worry about giving me your personal info, because this code will be running on your machine.

# Which file to use?
`Manual.py` runs it when you tell it to, and then stops once it's done. `Auto.py` will do this automatically every week, when the new free games are added to the Epic Games store. If you are using Auto, I recommend leaving it on the night before and getting your games in the morning, but that is up to you.
